    title: "Common Language Description",
    content: `An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart. The test is performed with the patient lying prone on the exam table. Small plastic patches are attached at specific locations on the chest, abdomen, arms, and/or legs. Leads (wires) from the ECG tracing device are then attached to the patches. A tracing is obtained of the electrical signals from the heart. 

Electrical activity begins in the sinoatrial node, which generates an electrical stimulus at regular intervals, usually 60 to 100 times per minute. This stimulus travels through the conduction pathways to the sinoatrial node causing the atria to contract. The stimulus then travels along the bundle of His, which divides into right and left pathways providing electrical stimulation of the ventricles causing them to contract. Each contraction of the ventricles represents one heart beat. 

The ECG tracing includes the following elements: P wave, QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave. The P wave, a small upward notch in the tracing, indicates electrical stimulation of the atria. This is followed by the QRS complex, which indicates the ventricles are electrically stimulated to contract. The short flat ST segment follows and indicates the time between the end of the ventricular contraction and the T wave. The T wave represents the recovery period of the ventricles. 

The physician reviews, interprets, and provides a written report of the ECG recording taking care to note any abnormalities. Use 93000 to report the complete procedure, including ECG tracing with physician review, interpretation, and report; use 93005 to report the tracing only; and use 93010 to report physician interpretation and written report only.`,
